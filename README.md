‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Disclaimer**:  WalletGen is a tool for research and educational purposes only. It is not designed for any unauthorized or malicious activities.  Always use it responsibly, only with wallets you have explicit permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen utilizes the robust methods of [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for the generation of Bitcoin wallets, and employs the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing algorithm for EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum.

The main function of this software includes comparing generated addresses against pre-existing databases of wallets and also checking the current balances in real-time, through the use of public blockchain explorers. WalletGen, built in C++, is open-source, providing users with a faster and more efficient method compared to alternative tools. This speed boost relies heavily on your CPU & GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Crypto Balance Verification?

Tired of slow balance checks? **WalletGen** is engineered for speed!  Unlike the slower, Python-based options, WalletGen is written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, delivering up to **10x faster** performance.  Whether you need to quickly verify balances, explore existing wallets, or recover your own holdings, WalletGen offers a powerful, efficient, and secure solution.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** enables the ability to check wallet balances using brute-force methods.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   To begin, use key `3` in the menu, or run `start_search_btc.bat`, for a real-time search for balances across the internet. Note: this may take longer because it uses blockchain explorers.
*   Alternatively, press `6` to utilize the database search for a faster method.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for the internet-based balance search.
*   Press `6` for a faster search, utilizing the database.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The speed of the search depends heavily on your hardware, especially the graphics card (GPU). Running multiple instances of the program (1 to 4) can greatly increase your chances of finding a wallet with a balance.

Databases dramatically improve efficiency by eliminating the need for constant blockchain queries.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When WalletGen detects a wallet with a balance:
*   The process will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details are **Displayed** in the console.
*   The data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into any compatible crypto wallet (such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You will then be able to transfer the funds to your own wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can recover Bitcoin wallets using the seed phrase. Enter the complete seed phrase, or use wildcards to search for missing words.

### Process Description

#### Search for Missing Words:

Use * to represent missing words. WalletGen checks all combinations.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed. WalletGen generates and checks addresses.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrases have 12 words.
*   Use * only for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words takes time.
*   Upon recovery, data is saved.
